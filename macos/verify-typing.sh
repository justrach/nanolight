# The panel's query never goes back to what it showed before a key (#24, a
# drawable from a slowed display link covering the newer one). Types a word,
# waits as a person pauses, deletes it, and watches the query's pixels: from
# the word to the placeholder and no further. The word coming back counts.
#
#   sh macos/verify-typing.sh [cycles]
#
# Needs /Applications/Nanolight.app, running with its panel in front. Presses
# keys, so CI only. If most cycles see the word's pixels never change, it fails
# in any mode: the keys went elsewhere, and "never went back" would mean
# nothing. An odd such cycle doesn't: builds with the bug have them (5 of 60 on
# v0.2.7, none of 24 on the fix).
# EXPECT=rollback inverts the verdict (a known-bad build must fail); EXPECT=any
# only reports (a pull request can't change the published build it runs on).
# SHOTS keeps what it saw of a rollback.
